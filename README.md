🚀 **Ocular Disease Classification using Deep Learning**

***Deep Learning Project for Diagnosing Eye Diseases with CNNs***

I'm excited to share my latest project on **Ocular Disease Classification**, where I implemented deep learning techniques to classify various eye diseases from retinal images. This project explores how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be leveraged to enhance early disease detection and improve ophthalmological diagnostics.

🔍 **Project Overview:**

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of diagnosing different ocular diseases using retinal images. Early detection of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts is crucial to preventing vision loss. This project applies deep learning techniques to analyze retinal images and classify diseases with high accuracy.
